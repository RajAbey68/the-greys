# Implementation Plan - Regenerate Culturally Accurate Images

The user has correctly pointed out that the previous images were culturally inappropriate (generic Western/White) for a Sri Lankan "Royal-Thomian" Big Match context. I must immediately correct this by regenerating the images with specific cultural markers.

## Target Images to Regenerate
1.  **`public/grey-meetups.png`** (Critical): Must show Sri Lankan people.
    *   *Prompt*: "Group of Sri Lankan friends, men and women, having a good time at the Royal-Thomian cricket big match in Colombo, holding beer and arrack cocktails, wearing sunglasses and smart casual summer clothes, blue and gold and black and blue theme, South Asian ethnicity, sunny outdoor cricket ground background, lively atmosphere."
2.  **`public/humour-rumour.png`**: Must reflect the local "Papare" and school boy culture.
    *   *Prompt*: "Funny illustration of Sri Lankan cricket fans at a match in Colombo, 'Papare' band energetic atmosphere, wearing straw hats and school colors (Blue & Gold / Blue & Black), cheering and laughing, South Asian characters, caricature style, vibrant."
3.  **`public/food-spirits.png`**: Ensure it looks like "Bites" and Arrack.
    *   *Prompt*: "A table spread of Sri Lankan 'bites' (devilled chicken, cutlets, mixture), a bottle of Arrack, and Lion Lager beer, outdoor cricket club setting in Colombo, sunny day, authentic Sri Lankan party food photography."

## Workflow
1.  **Generate** images with the corrected, specific prompts.
2.  **Overwrite** the existing files in `public/`.
3.  **Confirm** visuals are culturally appropriate.
